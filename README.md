Student Grade Manager
Overview
The Student Grade Manager is a Python program designed to help track and manage student grades. It allows users to input grades for various subjects or assignments, calculates the average grade, and displays the overall grade, including the letter grade and GPA based on the average score.

This project is ideal for students or educators who want to manage and evaluate academic performance in a straightforward and efficient manner. It includes the following key features:

Input and track grades for multiple subjects or assignments.
Calculate the average grade.
Display the corresponding letter grade and GPA.
Handle invalid inputs and provide feedback to the user.
Features
Grade Input: Users can input grades for different assignments or subjects.
Average Calculation: Automatically calculates the average grade from the entered grades.
Letter Grade: Based on the average, the program determines the letter grade (A, B, C, D, F).
GPA Calculation: The GPA is calculated based on the average grade using a standard scale.
Error Handling: Provides clear error messages for invalid inputs.
How It Works
The user is prompted to enter grades for various subjects or assignments. They can type "done" to stop entering grades.
The program validates each grade to ensure it's within the valid range (0-100).
After the user has entered all grades, the program calculates the average grade.
Based on the average, the program determines the letter grade and GPA.
A summary with the grades, average, letter grade, and GPA is displayed to the user.
Future Enhancements
Add functionality to store and retrieve grades from a file or database.
Include more detailed reporting, such as the highest/lowest grade.
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.
